# Example: Validating @tool Scripts with Godot Doctor

This example demonstrates how Godot Doctor provides a superior, less verbose way
to validate configuration requirements on **@tool** scripts. It also
demonstrates that Godot Doctor can handle `@tool` scripts, as well as regular
scripts.

## The Issue: Limitations of `_get_configuration_warnings()`

In native Godot development, the `_get_configuration_warnings()` function is the
standard way to check a node's configuration in the editor. However, this
approach has several drawbacks Godot Doctor seeks to resolve:

1. **Manual Updates and Boilerplate:** The native warnings often don't update
   automatically when a scene is saved, especially for child nodes. Fixing this
   requires adding cumbersome boilerplate code, such as hooking into
   `NOTIFICATION_EDITOR_POST_SAVE` and manually calling
   `update_configuration_warnings()`.
2. **String-Based Validation:** `_get_configuration_warnings()` forces you to
   return a `PackedStringArray`. This means your validation logic is written
   _inside_ a function that returns the error message strings, cluttering your
   logic and making it harder to separate the condition check from the error
   metadata.
3. **Code Contamination:** Adding `@tool` to a script to enable editor
   functionality means you must often pollute your gameplay-related functions
   (like `_process(delta)`) with editor-specific checks
   (`if Engine.is_editor_hint(): return`) to prevent them from running in the
   editor loop. This makes your core game code less clean.

## The Solution

Godot Doctor allows you to use the standard **`_get_validation_conditions()`**
method on **@tool** scripts, offering a clean alternative:

1. **Automatic, Comprehensive Validation:** Godot Doctor automatically runs
   validation on all nodes in a scene upon save, including child nodes,
   eliminating the need for manual update boilerplate.
2. **Cleaner Logic (Separation of Concerns):** By using `ValidationCondition`,
   you define the validation check (a boolean expression) and the error message
   (a string) separately, resulting in cleaner, more maintainable, and easily
   **testable** code.
3. **Unified Workflow:** You use the same consistent `ValidationCondition`
   syntax for validating both regular and `@tool` scripts, simplifying your
   development process.

## This Example

The `verify_tool_script_example.tscn` scene contains one child node,
**`ToolNode`**, which has the `@tool` script `tool_script.gd` attached.

This script exports two properties, `my_int` and `my_max_int`, and defines a
single `ValidationCondition`:

```gdscript
@tool
# ...
@export var my_int: int = 105 # Default value set high
@export var my_max_int: int = 100 # Default value set low

func _get_validation_conditions() -> Array[ValidationCondition]:
    var conditions: Array[ValidationCondition] = [
        ValidationCondition.simple(
            my_int <= my_max_int,
            "my_int must be less than %s but is %s" % [my_max_int, my_int]
        ),
    ]
    return conditions
```

Verifying this scene results in an error:

- The validation **fails** because the default value of `my_int` (`105`) is
  greater than `my_max_int` (`100`).
- **Resolution:** To fix this error, change the value of **My Int** to `100` or
  less in the Inspector. This demonstrates a core configuration requirement
  being validated on an `@tool` script using the superior Godot Doctor syntax.
