# Example: Verifying Node Exports

This example demonstrates Godot Doctor's capability to verify conditions for
**exported properties** on a `Node` in a scene.

## The Issue

In Godot, it's common to use the `@export` keyword to expose properties in the
editor.

You can get configuration warnings for those properties, such as missing
references, but we'd have to make the script an `@tool` script to be able to run
`_get_configuration_warnings()` in the editor.

This introduces quite a lot of boilerplate code, to ensure that the gameplay
code is not executed in the editor. A good example of this can be found in the
main `README` for `Godot Doctor`. In short, it requires us to bloat our gameplay
code with calls like `if Editor.is_editor_hint() return`, and subscribe to
`Notification`s to ensure that the checks are re-evaluated when properties
change in the editor.

Furthermore, `_get_configuration_warnings()` only allows us to return a list of
strings, which means we're encouraged to write code that returns strings, rather
than code that evaluates our actual conditions.

## The Solution

**Godot Doctor** allows you to define custom validation checks for a `Node`'s
(or `Resource`) exported properties directly within its script using the
`_get_validation_conditions()` function.

1. **Validate using simple boolean checks:** You can create checks with
   arbitrary logic (like ensuring a string is non-empty after trimming
   whitespace or matches a specific value, or that a number is strictly greater
   than zero).
2. **Complex validation using Callables:** You can write `Callable`s for complex
   conditions for any exported reference, ensuring they are valid and meet
   specific criteria. These `Callables` can even contain nested
   `ValidationCheck`s if need be.
3. **Default Validations:** Godot Doctor also has a few default validations
   built-in, such as checking whether an object is valid (aka not null), or
   whether strings are non-mepty. If you have `use_default_validations` enabled
   in Godot Doctor's settings, these will automatically run, regardless of
   whether you have a `_get_validation_conditions()` function attached to the
   script. Note that these default validation checks do _not_ run on nodes that
   do not have a script attached.

By running these checks in the editor, you catch configuration errors at design
time, well before they cause a problem during gameplay.

## This Example

In this example, we have a scene, `verify_exports_example.tscn`, which contains
a `Node` called `NodeWithExports` with the script `script_with_exports.gd`
attached. This script defines three exported variables: `my_string`, `my_int`,
and `my_node`.

Let's look at the validation conditions defined in `script_with_exports.gd`:

```gdscript
## Get `ValidationCondition`s for exported variables.
func _get_validation_conditions() -> Array[ValidationCondition]:
 return [
  # The string not empty check is handled by the default validation conditions
  # and thus does not need a validation condition here.
  # An example is shown here in case you turned default validation off in Godot Doctor's settings.
  #
  # A helper method for the condition below is ValidationCondition.is_stripped_string_not_empty,
  # which does the exact same thing, but standardizes the error message.
  # ValidationCondition.simple(
  #  not my_string.strip_edges().is_empty(), "my_string must not be empty"
  # ),
  ValidationCondition.simple(my_int > 0, "my_int must be greater than zero"),
  ValidationCondition.new(
   func() -> bool:
    return is_instance_valid(my_node) and my_node.name == "ExpectedNodeName",
   "my_node must be valid and named 'ExpectedNodeName'"
  )
  # Note that we could also use the helper method ValidationCondition.is_instance_valid
  # to check if my_node is valid, which would standardize the error message, but that
  # would not check if the name matches ExpectedNodeName.
 ]

```

Verifying this scene results in **three errors** because none of the default
exported values meet the conditions:

1. **`my_string` is empty:** The default value `""` fails the default validation
   check.
   - **Resolution:** Set a non-empty string value for **My String** in the
     Inspector.
2. **`my_int` is not positive:** The default value `-42` fails the `my_int > 0`
   check.
   - **Resolution:** Set a value greater than `0` for **My Int** in the
     Inspector.
3. **`my_node` is invalid/incorrectly named:** The default value is null,
   failing the check that it must be a valid instance.
   - **Resolution 1:** Drag the `WronglyNamedNode` from the scene tree into the
     **My Node** property slot in the Inspector. This will resolve the "invalid"
     part, but it will still fail the check because its name is not
     `'ExpectedNodeName'`.
     - **Resolution 2:** You'll then need to rename the node in the scene to
       `'ExpectedNodeName'` to fully resolve this specific error.
