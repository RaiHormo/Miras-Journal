I feel like I'm in a city... I walk around... 
There is one central building... Lots of people...
Suddenly my view shatters, i see many pieces of glass around me that reflect like mirrors.... 
The people around me are gone, but I feel like there is still someone with me... 
I hear a loud noise

...
So finding these bunkers might give us clues on how to escape.
Or it could just be a complete dead-end.
I hope Daze's hypothesis is right... it seems like our only hope right now.
As long as we have something to strive for, it'll all be fine...
...
I guess it's time to leave now, the others should be waiting up at the gate.
