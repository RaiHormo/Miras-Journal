I don't even know what the date is.
Today I woke up in the middle of this strange forest.
I can't recall how I got here or what I'm doing here, my memory is a fog.
Well, maybe that's not completly accurate, I can remember who I am at least.
Mira Levenor, 19 year old Cyrenian who lives in Neortoria.
I have to write that down in case I forget that too.

Mira: What can I even do?

	Daze.Neutral: That's a long story... and doesn't really matter.
	He just brushes that off, okay.
	Daze.Neutral: What matters is I was seprated from my comanions while traveling.
- Where are we?
	Mira.Neutral: Do you have any idea where we are?
	Daze.Neutral: I'm not so sure... I don't remember exactly how I got here.
	Daze.Neutral: However I speculate that this place is disconnected from the outside world.
	Mira.Neutral: Huh?! How so?
	Daze.Neutral: Do you remember how you got here? Have you tried walking far away?
	Mira.Neutral: I don't remember much...
	Mira.Neutral: And no, I was just walking through an abandoned town.
	Mira.Neutral: What do you mean?
	Daze.Neutral: It'll be easier to show than tell, hold that thought.
	Huh? What does he want to show me?
	Daze.Neutral: Any other questions?
- How did you know my name?
	Mira.Neutral: How did you know my name? Do you know me?
	Daze.Neutral: Oh, it's because of this...
	He picks up a book next to him... wait that's my journal!
	I quickly take it from him.
	Mira.Neutral: Hey! Where did you even find this?!
	Mira.Neutral: You can't just read people's personal Journals!
	Daze.Neutral: I'm sorry. It was the only way I could know who you are, since you were unconscious...
	Mira.Neutral: How much did you read!?
	Daze.Neutral: Only a few pages, but a lot of the pages also seem to have been ripped out of it.
	Mira.Neutral: Wait what? How did that happen?
	Daze.Neutral: I don't know, this is how I found it.
	It's true, many of the pages seem ripped out.
	I should take a closer look later.
- About the monster...
	Mira.Neutral: How did you take on that monster so easily?
	Daze.Neutral: Oh it was already quite weakened, I simply finished it off.
	Mira.Neutral: But you just... cleanly sliced a rock in half. With a sword. Like it's BREAD! How is that even possible?!
	Daze.Neutral: What can I say, I'm just that skilled~
	Daze.Neutral: No, you had weakened its Aura shield quite a bit. 
	Daze.Neutral: Monsters like that are pretty fragile once their control over their physical parts is weakened.
	Daze.Neutral: Anything else?
- About Alcine...
	Mira.Neutral: Did you happen to see something like a water spirit with spirally aura where you found me?
	Daze.Neutral: I apologize, but no. Was it important?
	Mira.Neutral: Quite a bit...
	I should go back and look for them at some point later.
- Can I have some water?
	Mira.Neutral: You got any water?
	Daze.Neutral: Here.
	He brings a bottle of water. I drink it all quickly.
	Mira.Neutral: Do you have any more?
	He gives me another bottle, I also drink it quickly.
	Mira.Neutral: Ahh... I didn't drink anything the whole day yesterday...
